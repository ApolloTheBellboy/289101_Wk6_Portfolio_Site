                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>My name is Polina Beliaeva (but I also go by Linn!)</p>
                    <p>I was born in Kursk, Russia, but have been living in Wellington for nearly 12 years</p>
                    <p>I have had an interest in art and various crafts since I was little, but I would say my art career really started in 2017, when I created my first lined work.</p>
                    <p>In my spare time I like watching Youtube, drawing and listening to music.</p>
                    <p>When I have more time and energy I enjoy anime, knitting, sewing, embroidery, crochet and videogames</p>
